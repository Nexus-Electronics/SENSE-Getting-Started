** Getting Started Guide in development 
** More examples and demos will be added 

*Aren't sure what to make with SENSE or need a challenge? Consider these ideas:*
- IoT Weather Station (use micro SD card to log environmental data and time) 
- Smart Garden Monitor 
- Touchless Volume Control using Gesture Sensing (hand movements)  
- High Altitude Weather Balloon 
- Clap Switch 
- Desktop Air Quality Monitor 
- Touchless Faucet
- Indoor Noise Level Monitor 
- Control the heater/air conditioning based on indoor temperature data
- Use two SENSE boards to open/close window based on indoor v.s. outdoor air quality 
- RGB LED that changes color based on color sensor readings 
- Proximity Door/Window Security (lets you know if your door/window is open/closed) 
- LED Clock using real-time-clock data
